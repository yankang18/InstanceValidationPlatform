<typical clr is 3x the od of the tube without mandrels. it is possible to bend on a 1 or 2xd bend, but not without more complex tooling. tooling costs also increase when comparing a plug mandrel to 3-ball mandrel & wiper die. the tighter the radius, the more tooling required and the more expensive the part.>&&&<SubConcept>&&&<CLR- Center Line Radius:>&&&< >&&&< >&&&<Builtin>
